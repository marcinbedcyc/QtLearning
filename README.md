# QtLearning
Exercises from Graphics And Multimedia Labs about all kind of algorithms connected to paiting/drawing shapes on computer's screen
The project has 4 sections: 
- Curves, 
- QtLearning, 
- ModeleBarw (in Engilsh color Palette RGB, HSV),
- BlendModes

***
### CURVES
The curves is about B-spline curve and Bezier curve. User of this simple program can chose certain points and it will be drawn 
a curve depends of points. User can also delete points and change their position.

#### B-spline curve:

#### Bezier curve:

### MODELE BARW
modeleBarw is about conversion pixels' colors from RGB to HSV and from HSV to RGB. User can change every channel (H, S ,V).
It has impact on image's result.

### QTLEARNING
QtLearning is about:
- Drawing basic shapes like circles, elipses, rectagles, rectagles' frames, paiting with sprays,
- FloodFill algorithm which flood shapes with color chosen by user, 
- ScanLine algorithm which draws irregular polygons,
user chose points, connection between pairs creates edge, then it fills inside of shape with color using scanLine algorithm(liny by line), 
- Morphology operations e.g dilation, erosion.
